# Practical works on deep machine learning

### UPD. Eventually, I decided to create new brunches because it is easier to swap between practical works, but I will be merging all changes to **master** to view and show my skill growth
### Also I discovered that in Jupiter I can design text between code blocks, so I'll move tasks to them since this work. My comments will be framed by blockquotes 

## Installation and startup (Windows)

At first you need to clone repo to selected folder

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FVladislove/Deep-machine-learning-labs.git
cd Deep-machine-learning-labs
```

Next you must create virtual environment and activate it

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
venv/Scripts/activate
```

Then you must install required modules

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, you can select kernel (venv in our case) and run the file using VSCode or JupyterLab
